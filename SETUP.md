## Android

Android APPs needs to be signed with a keystore. The keystore is a file that contains a private key and a certificate. The private key is used to sign the APK, and the certificate is used to verify that the APK was signed with that private key. The keystore is used to sign the APK before it is uploaded to the Play Store.
